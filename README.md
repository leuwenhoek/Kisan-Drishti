Kisan Dhristi is an AI-powered web application designed to empower farmers by providing instant crop disease identification and actionable treatment guidance. By leveraging machine learning, the platform allows farmers to upload a photo of an affected crop leaf and receive a diagnosis along with step-by-step instructions in their local language. The application aims to reduce crop losses due to delayed or inaccurate diagnoses, particularly for small-scale farmers.
